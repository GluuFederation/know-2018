# Know-2018: Decentralized Identity Standards Panel

Centralized cloud identity has peaked. Distributed ledgers, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable claims have made sovereign identity possible. The benefits to people are overwhelming, especially with regard to privacy, control of data, and fraud reduction. Three standard technologies in particular stand out as enablers of this new digital identity infrastructure: (1) OpenID Connect, an OAuth based federated identity layer; (2) Sovrin, an advanced distributed ledger technology; (3) FIDO, a standards-based cryptographic authentication protocol. This session will provide an overview of each of these technologies as well as references to open source software that can be deployed today to put it to work. |

## Questions for panelists

* FIDO|OpenID|Sovrin: What is the core problem it solves?  How is it an enabler of sovereign identity?

* Some might say that adoption is more important then standards. What are the drivers for adoption of all these technologies?

* Where do FIDO, OpenID and Sovrin need to work-together? What are the potential intersection points?

* On the Internet today, privacy seems like a utopian fantasy. How will FIDO|OpenID|Sovrin foster privacy? To what extent do you think privacy is
necessary for progress?

* There is no inherent trust between two Internet domains, e.g. abc.com
doesn't trust xyz.com. To what extent is trust management a barrier to
progress today, and how does OpenID|FIDO|Sovrin provide a bridge?

* Can OpenID|FIDO|Sovereign identity succeed without open source software? If
not, should open source also be considered a essential component of
decentralized identity?
