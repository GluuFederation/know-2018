# Know-2018: Decentralized Identity Standards Panel

Centralized cloud identity has peaked. Distributed ledgers, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable claims have made sovereign identity possible. The benefits to people are overwhelming, especially with regard to privacy, control of data, and fraud reduction. Three standard technologies in particular stand out as enablers of this new digital identity infrastructure: (1) OpenID Connect, an OAuth based federated identity layer; (2) Sovrin, an advanced distributed ledger technology; (3) FIDO, a standards-based cryptographic authentication protocol. This session will provide an overview of each of these technologies as well as references to open source software that can be deployed today to put it to work. |
