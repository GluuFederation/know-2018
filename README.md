# Know-2018: Decentralized Identity Standards Panel

Centralized cloud identity has peaked. Distributed ledgers, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable claims have made sovereign identity possible. The benefits to people are overwhelming, especially with regard to privacy, control of data, and fraud reduction. Three standard technologies in particular stand out as enablers of this new digital identity infrastructure: (1) OpenID Connect, an OAuth based federated identity layer; (2) Sovrin, an advanced distributed ledger technology; (3) FIDO, a standards-based cryptographic authentication protocol. This session will provide an overview of each of these technologies as well as references to open source software that can be deployed today to put it to work. |

## Mike's Intro

* Thank 1 World Identity, panelists and attendees! (Wait for people to sit down...)
* Logistical details: link to slides, Twitter hashtag #know-you
* Brief intro of each panelist
* Quick definition of "sovereign identity"
* Pose question: "Has centralized cloud identity peaked?"
* But before we dive into that... ACRONYM DISCLAIMER + Infographic

## Questions for panelists

1. Has centralized cloud identity peaked? Is sovereign identity possible? Is
it likely?

1. FIDO|OpenID|Sovrin: What is the core problem it solves? Do you agree with the infographic? How could FIDO|OpenID|Sovrin enable decentralized identity?

1. On the Internet today, privacy seems like a utopian fantasy. To what extent
do you think privacy is necessary for progress?

1. There is no inherent trust between two Internet domains, e.g. abc.com
doesn't trust xyz.com. To what extent is trust management a barrier to
sovereign identity, and do OpenID|FIDO|Sovrin provide a bridge?

1. FIDO|OpenID|Sovrin are technical components of a sovereign identity
ecosystem. Are there missing technical components? What about business or legal
components?
